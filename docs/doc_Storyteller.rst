The Storyteller Component
=========================

The Storyteller Component is an important feature of `Inversionson` as it
automatically documents everything that happens in the inversion. It documents
events used in each iteration, the coverage that they result in and the misfit
changes between iterations.

All of this is written into a markdown file, easily viewable in a browser
through a markdown reader extention.

This could be extended to post information to an actual live website as
the inversion goes on.
